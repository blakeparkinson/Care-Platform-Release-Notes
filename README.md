## 🌟 Enhancements
**Updated Layout**

_Check-In Results and Schedule Buttons made more accessible_

We’ve updated your My Clients page based on feedback to make the Check-In Results and Schedule buttons more accessible. These two buttons have been moved to the top of your left panel, which will no longer require you to scroll to access these buttons. We’ve also moved the End Care button to the bottom of the page. This button is not intended to be used often and so we have moved it lower on the Client’s profile. Thank you all for your feedback to make this change happen!

## 🎉 New Features
**Help Center Embedded in Care Platform**

We’re launching a new “Support” page in the Care Platform to help you find answers to any questions you may have easier & faster. You can access this by clicking the **?** icon in the side navigation. This page is linked to our Clinician Help Center (and contains the same content), but is now located in a more accessible spot. Check it out to learn more about the Care Platform, Healthie, troubleshooting tips, and more!

## 🌟 Enhancements
**Care Platform Security Upgrade – Inactivity Timeout**

Keeping our system (and client information!) 🔒**safe and secure**🔒 is one of our most important jobs here at Two Chairs. In an effort to enhance the security of our system, we’re adding an inactivity timeout to the Care Platform. You’re likely already familiar with this behavior in Healthie, or in other apps you use that store sensitive/private data (think - your banking app, or healthcare app like Kaiser). We know this behavior can be disruptive, so we’re doing everything we can to make this feel as smooth as possible for you all.

A few details to note:
- The Care Platform will soon automatically log you out if you are inactive for 60 minutes
  - This might be because you are away from your computer entirely, or that you’ve just left that particular tab/window. A single click in your Care Platform tab would be considered “activity” and keep you logged in.
- It only takes 1-2 clicks to get back into the app, since we use Google/SSO for login
- Upon logging back in, you’ll be redirected back to the page you were previously on (rather than back to the dashboard, and needing to remember what you were doing!)

## 🎉 New Features

**Termination Tooling**

Ending care with clients requires many operational steps, in addition to your clinical work. Moving forward, we’ll handle the non-clinical work (like canceling sessions) for you, so you can focus on supporting your clients at this big milestone in their care journey. Read more about this new tool [here]([url](https://cliniciansupport.twochairs.com/hc/en-us/articles/29451579963028-How-to-end-care-with-a-client)) and the new Termination Note [here]([url](https://cliniciansupport.twochairs.com/hc/en-us/articles/26817864973716-Writing-a-termination-note-in-Healthie)).

A few changes to note:
- When you’ve had your last session with a client, click the “End Care” button in the Care Platform & click through the prompts
- Upcoming sessions will be canceled for you
- A termination note will automatically be created in your client’s chart & will appear in your Documentation Reminders so you don’t lose track
- Bonus: we’ve streamlined the Termination Note template to be quicker and easier to complete!

## 🌟 Enhancements
- **Clarified session counting:** Previously, the “Sessions” field in the Care Platform only showed the number of sessions the client has had with the current clinician. This became confusing in the case of rematches, or clients returning to care. Now, we’ll be showing the current clinician session count alongside the client’s full episode of care session count

- **Removed outdated references to “tracks” and “session ranges”:** We made some changes in the Care Platform to remove guidance/features that are not in alignment with our current Care Model & were causing confusion
- **Ported the My Clients Schedule and List pages into Roofdog (our new Care Platform application):** With these pages now living in the new Care Platform, we made updates that allow for an overall better and more accessible user experience, particularly in the My Clients list view

# 🚀 July 2024 Release Notes 🚀

**Update to Requeue Reasons**

Requeueing refers to putting a client back in the queue after they have been matched, but *before* they have attended a first therapy session with a treatment clinician. It’s an important workflow, but since it’s a process to manage exceptions, it’s a window into ways that our current system isn’t totally serving our needs. During requeues, we capture “requeue reasons” to better understand these exceptions.

In July, we made some small changes to how we capture requeue reasons to improve our ability to learn from these exceptions. We added 1 new reason, ““clinician-initiated - conflicts with company/team meeting.” If “client-initiated — other” or “clinician-initiated — other” are selected, we also added a conditional text field that prompts the user for more info about the reason. These two “other” options account for ~19% of responses, so there is a big opportunity here to learn.

*Note: “client-initiated...” is a category we reserve for requeues that happen when the client has requested the requeue due to schedule, clinical fit, etc., while “clinician-initiated” is used for situations where the clinician has requested the requeue.
We’re excited for the to learn more from the data we’ll be able to gather with these changes!*

**Client Scheduler Onboarding and Full Launch**

This has been a HUGE month for our Client Scheduler product. Over the final weeks of July, we released a series of high-impact to clinicians to make client scheduling intuitive, simple, and easy.
  - Released Full-Time Onboarding Wizard for onboarding full-time clinicians
    - Introduces clinicians to the product and guides them through how Client Scheduler will work
    - Provides a template schedule and clear guidance on how to first establish availability
- Released Full-Time Ramp experience to onboarding full-time clinicians
    - We brought the ramp experience that we developed last year into a fully-automated and intuitive interface. It provides clinicians the context they need to set up their schedules and helps clinicians understand the guardrails we have around schedules to ensure we can meet client needs and demand.
- Released Client Scheduler to all Full-Time and Network clinicians (with the exception of those doing consults)
    - Network: provides a self-service model, taking the lift off clinical leads & allowing for real-time updates to give Network clinicians the flexibility they need.
    - Network clinicians can directly edit their autoschedule target # of scheduled sessions and available
    - Client Scheduler then guides clinicians to provide enough hours for the new clients needed, without breaching labor laws on max back-to-back or daily sessions.
- Released Network Onboarding Wizard for onboarding Network clinicians
    - Invites clinicians to set their target hours before accessing the tool, and explains how to manage availability.
- Released Network Ramp experience for onboarding Network clinicians
    - For the first time, we now offer an automated Ramp experience for network clinicians. We built on our learnings from full-time ramp to offer clinicians an automated experience that gets clinicians to their target and takes the guess-work out of the process.

# 🚀 June 2024 Release Notes 🚀

**Client Scheduler**

We’ve been working tirelessly on improving the scheduling experience for our clinicians. As part of new software launch, we “beta test” the tool with a small group to get their feedback & make updates before launching to the entire team. In June, we started beta testing Client Scheduler with the part-time team. So far, we’ve heard a lot of positive feedback. Updates for network users include:

- Client Scheduler for Network clinicians provides a self-service model, taking the lift off clinical leads & allowing for real-time updates to give Network clinicians the flexibility they need.
- Network clinicians can directly edit their autoschedule target # of scheduled sessions and available
- Client Scheduler then guides clinicians to provide enough hours for the new clients needed, without breaching labor laws on max back-to-back or daily sessions.
- “Edit mode” makes it more apparent when you’re making changes, and tracks edits as clinicians add/delete so they can check before saving.

**Switch All Clinicians from Zoom to Meet**

To simplify and scale we needed to align on a consistent strategy for video conferencing for sessions. We successfully made the conversion (all consults and client sessions are now conducted via Google Meet) and learned some lessons along the way.

## 🎉 New Features

**Documentation Reminders**

Notes are a key part of clinical documentation, but not the full story. To better support clinicians in completing timely & high quality documentation, we’re expanding our “Incomplete Notes” feature to encompass notes, diagnosis codes and treatment plans.

Now, you’ll be reminded of the following documentation needs on your dashboard:
- When a session note is due, or if it is overdue
- When a diagnosis code is due, or if it is overdue
- If your client is missing an active & primary diagnosis code in their chart
- When a treatment plan is due, or if it is overdue
- If a treatment plan is present but not active
- If a treatment goal is missing a due date
- If a treatment goal is nearing its due date, or has expired

While this feature is not intended to be a replacement for the Looker dashboards on documentation timeliness and compliance and is not inclusive of all quality/compliance indicators, we hope that this feature **empowers clinicians by providing direct visibility** into their outstanding or upcoming documentation needs

<img width="622" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-30 at 1 50 01 PM" src="https://github.com/blakeparkinson/Care-Platform-Release-Notes/assets/171188179/09915656-ac69-4b37-9fc7-79baee813132">


*Note: In the case of a client returning to care with the same clinician, the due date listed on the treatment plan or dx code reminder may show the old first session date. We will refine this logic over time to improve this experience.*


**In-App Product Announcements**

To help communicate about new feature launches, we’ll be displaying announcements directly in the Care Platform. Our first version of this will go live today to announce the Documentation Reminders feature.


**Consult Nudges**

We launched a number of small, in-product nudges in Matchmaker to support our consult clinicians in improving the number of clinical fits generated at the consult appointment. These tooling updates are an important first step in using our product experience to help our consult clinicians make more informed decisions in the matching process to ensure our clients needs are met in a timely manner.

# 🚀 April 2024 Release Notes 🚀

## 🎉 New Features

- **Integrated Looker into the Care Platform for Clinicical Managers:** In a continuous effort to make the Care Platform a one stop shop, we've added Looker to the care platform. Clinical Managers will now be directed to the new "manager-dashboard" page on login, where they can interact with looker.

<img width="1511" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-02 at 4 23 59 PM" src="https://github.com/blakeparkinson/Care-Platform-Release-Notes/assets/1864277/0e64cd00-97d9-4856-92e7-9afcd131f4db">


## 🌟 Enhancements

- **Added 30 minute buffer window so no client surveys go left behind:** Sometimes clinicians need to schedule last minute appoinments, this change ensures that clients will still receive surveys even if they are scheduled last minute.

- **Ported the Utilization page to Roofdog (the new Care Platform):** With the Utilization page now living in the new Care Platform, we made updates that allow for an overall better and more accessible user experience.

## 🔧 Improvements

- **Centralized API Layer:** Rather than the Care Platform relying on the browser to make API calls to multiple servies and perform heavy computational logic, we've moved these calls to a dedicated API layer which allows the browser to do its primary job(rendering the page.) This also puts us in a place to begin building Role Based Access.

- **Introduced smart caching:** We're now caching data which skips trips to the server, and makes the care platform feel incredibly snappy overall.
